# Drive-Video-Splitter-colab
Split large drive videos to online watchable in colab



# What is the problem? 
     Large videos cannot be watched in drive directly. 
     
     
# Proposed solution: 
     Split large videos into smaller chunks and save it in drive
   
   
# How does it work?
1. Import Drive into colab 
2. Split video files into smaller chunks 
3. Save the split videos in drive
4. Watch the split videos in drive
